Smart Farming AI Agent

This project is part of my capstone at Manipur Institute of Technology. I built an AI-powered agent using IBM Cloud services to help small-scale farmers get real-time, localized farming advice in a simple and accessible way.

What’s the problem?

Many small farmers don’t have easy access to farming information like:

* Weather updates
* Which crops are best to grow right now
* Pest control tips
* Soil conditions
* Market prices

This information is often hard to find, outdated, or in a language they don’t understand. Because of this, farmers can end up making poor decisions that lead to crop failure or money loss.

My solution

I created an AI agent that answers farming questions in real time. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and IBM’s Granite foundation model to deliver helpful, localized advice. Farmers can ask questions like:

* What crop should I plant this season?
* How can I control pests in my tomatoes?
* Is it going to rain tomorrow?

The agent also supports local languages so it’s easy to use, even for people not familiar with technical terms.

Tools and technologies used

* IBM Cloud Lite services
* IBM Watsonx.ai Studio and Runtime
* IBM Cloud Agent Lab
* IBM Granite Foundation Model
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Who can use it?

* Farmers with smartphones
* Agri-tech startups
* Agricultural extension workers
* NGOs working in rural areas
* Rural youth interested in modern farming

What makes it special

* Gives suggestions based on live weather and soil data
* Offers pest control advice for different crops and regions
* Recommends crops based on season and local conditions
* Easy to talk to, even in local languages
* Helps save time, improve yields, and increase profits

Results so far

* The AI agent is deployed and live on IBM Cloud
* It successfully answers real-world farming questions
* It saves time and helps farmers make smart decisions

Future improvements

I plan to expand the project by adding:

* Satellite image analysis
* Voice commands for hands-free usage
* Crop yield prediction
* Tips for supply chain and pricing
* A farmer support community
* Sustainability and scoring systems

IBM Certifications

I earned the following IBM certifications as part of this project:
